                <h2 class="animate__animated animate__fadeInUp" style="animation-duration: 1.5s; animation-delay: 0.5s;">About me in detail:</h2>
        <p>I am a passionate game developer with a strong interest in creating immersive experiences. This passion has been burning strong since 2017, and has ended up with me studying software/game development at the Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht.</p>
        <p><br/>What started this passion initially I can only assume was watching content on youtube from various games and series that I wanted to make them myself.
        This started off simple, using Scratch to create various projects, often with goals out of reach but managing to make something out of it regardless. The goals for horror games were already set there and then, because I often tried making Five Nights At Freddy's knockoffs and recreating grotesque boss battles.</p>
        <p>After a couple years, around 2020, Covid-19 hit. This led to a lot of free time, which I decided to use by learning how to develop games on ROBLOX. Of course, this is a large step-up from scratch, as you no longer create code using codeblocks, so the first few games were mostly building.
            <br/><br/>
            After a couple months of asking friends and following tutorials on YouTube, I managed to learn enough to deviate from tutorials and write my own code, often only relying on Documentation and forums since then. The first few projects still flopped, but it showed a tremendous amount of improvement!
        </p>
        <p>around September 2021 I started the large-scale project <a href="../projectpages/project1.html" id="visiblelink">GTR:UF</a>, shaping it into one of my most ambitious works to date.</p>
        <p>Eventually, I decided to think about future plans, as with the progress of GTR:UF, ROBLOX wouldn't be able to suffice for stable income, considering I do want to make a job out of game development.<br/>
        This was timed perfectly around the start of 2024, as during high school, the computer science teacher game us the assignment to create a game. I decided to do this in Unity, ending up with <a href="../projectpages/project2.html" id="visiblelink">TERMINUS.</a>
        <br/>
        <br/> Now I'm happily creating projects and studying at GLU, learning more and more about game development every day. I have a lot of plans for the future, and the future gets brighter every day.
