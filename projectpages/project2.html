        <p>TERMINUS is my first ever look at making a relatively polished game in Unity, a completely new engine to me at that time.</p>
        <p>It's a small game that I've made as an assignment for high school, after having gotten permission from the teacher to use Unity, as I already knew which college i wanted to go to.</p>

        <p>It was meant as a project in a group of 4 people, but at high school, they saw computer science as a class where you didn't have to do anything. Of course, I had a different opinion about that, as shown in the video.</p>
        <p>The game is heavy inspired from ULTRAKILL, but more based on an immensely rewritten version of Terminus, a god in Roman religion. Speed and score were the ultimate goal, gameplay-wise.</p>

        <p>The overall style of industrial machinery of modern and old times is something i see a lot of value in for
            its messy and brutalistic structuring. I decided to follow this style while rebuilding the entire design of
            the game, leading to an outcome I would fall in love with and keep using from that point on.</p>
        <p>Aside from visuals, every script in the game was completely rewritten as well, fixing bugs and implementing
            tricks that optimize the overall game performance, such as removing lag-inducing loops, and making recurring
            mechanics throughout the map work on a single script.</p>
        <p>This was essential in games on ROBLOX, as each script is its individual piece of code, regardless of if there
            are multiple scripts with the same code. <span class="drama">Each new script added to the game would already
                cause even a noticeable fraction of additional lag.</span></p>

        <p>As my coding improved, I continuously came up with new ideas, and usually implemented them into GTR:UF, often
            leading to a positive and well-functioning outcome.</p>
        <p>I also started my composing career by making music for this game, but you can read more about that <a

        <p><br>In the end, I learned a lot from this project, and it was a great experience to work on. I am still proud
            of the result, even though it never truly got its final release.</p>
