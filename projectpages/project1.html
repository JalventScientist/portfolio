        <p>'Groundwork Tech Research: Underground Facility' was one of my largest projects on the platform ROBLOX to
            date. It aimed to greatly improve my skill at scripting, as well as environmental design.</p>
        <p>It was a large-scale project that took multiple years to work on, because back then i threw myself into the
            deep end, wanting to create a game that I had too few experience for at the beginning.</p>

        <p>Based on the opinion from the public, people found this to be one of the best visuals for this 'purge'
            effect, originating from Alien: Isolation, but having become a trend in the genre of games i was working in
            at that time.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, I made this project without any preparations, so there were no concepts, no stylesheets, just
            a blank piece of paper to start on. I decided for the second version of the game to do a complete overhaul,
            essentially starting from scratch.</p>

        <p>The overall style of industrial machinery of modern and old times is something i see a lot of value in for
            its messy and brutalistic structuring. I decided to follow this style while rebuilding the entire design of
            the game, leading to an outcome I would fall in love with and keep using from that point on.</p>
        <p>Aside from visuals, every script in the game was completely rewritten as well, fixing bugs and implementing
            tricks that optimize the overall game performance, such as removing lag-inducing loops, and making recurring
            mechanics throughout the map work on a single script.</p>
        <p>This was essential in games on ROBLOX, as each script is its individual piece of code, regardless of if there
            are multiple scripts with the same code. <span class="drama">Each new script added to the game would already
                cause even a noticeable fraction of additional lag.</span></p>

        <p>As my coding improved, I continuously came up with new ideas, and usually implemented them into GTR:UF, often
            leading to a positive and well-functioning outcome.</p>
        <p>I also started my composing career by making music for this game, but you can read more about that <a

        <p><br>In the end, I learned a lot from this project, and it was a great experience to work on. I am still proud
            of the result, even though it never truly got its final release.</p>
