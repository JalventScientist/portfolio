        <p>Bug-off! is the result that came out of a group project consisting of 6 artists and 2 developers.</p>
        <p>We were introduced to working with artists, with the goal of creating our own Shoot 'em up. This project lasted a couple weeks until our break in May.<br>Bug-off! Takes place in an alternate reality where life has been seperated by humans and bugs, forming the clear difference between utopia and dystopia.</p>

        <p>I was one of the two developers that worked on this project, along with taking the role of being one of the two representatives for the group to keep everyone working. Teams don't work without proper management, after all.</p>
        <p>While the artists worked hard on creating essential models, us developers made sure to create the building blocks that would eventually speed up level creation drastically.<br>
        Using scriptableObjects, we had created a wave system that stores the entire level inside a scriptableObject using multidimensional arrays. Another script would read those waves and spawned enemies based on the data, along with an option to spawn the boss as the last round.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately with most school projects, there's never a true dream team. We were one of the few unlucky ones to have one developer that wasn't nearly as motivated, leaving the work balance to be incredibly uneven. It essentially ended up with me coding everything except for the boss and the moth enemy.</p>
        <p>We had already discussed this within the team to do something about it which unfortunately didn't result in much, but despite all conflicts, this was certainly a project to be proud of.</p>
        <p><br>This project was set up to be like a game jam on itch.io with 5 prizes to be won. We got 5th place overall, but we at least got 2nd place for gameplay, with competition being really tight between Bug-off and another group.</span></p>
