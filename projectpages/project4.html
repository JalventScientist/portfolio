        <p>Bug-off! is the result that came out of a group project consisting of 6 artists and 2 developers.</p>
        <p>We were introduced to working with artists, with the goal of creating our own Shoot 'em up. This project lasted a couple weeks until our break in May.<br>Bug-off! Takes place in an alternate reality where life has been seperated by humans and bugs, forming the clear difference between utopia and dystopia.</p>

        <p>I was one of the two developers that worked on this project, along with taking the role of being one of the two representatives for the group to keep everyone working. Teams don't work without proper management, after all.</p>
        <p>While the artists worked hard on creating essential models, us developers made sure to create the building blocks that would eventually speed up level creation drastically.<br>
        Using <a href="https://github.com/GLU-Gaming/shmup-2025-stars2g/blob/main/Assets/Devs/Scripts/Gameplay/Waves/Waves/AdvancedWave.cs" id="visiblelink">scriptableObjects</a>, we had created a wave system that stores the entire level inside a scriptableObject using multidimensional arrays. <a href="https://github.com/GLU-Gaming/shmup-2025-stars2g/blob/main/Assets/Devs/Scripts/Gameplay/Waves/WaveReader.cs" id="visiblelink">Another script</a> would read those waves and spawned enemies based on the data, along with an option to spawn the boss as the last round.</p>

        <p>Working in teams in this way was not something I was completely used to, but I don't regret a single thing of it. It taught me how to properly plan out a project, make concept art for assets and the benefits that come with scrum/trello boards.</p>
        <p><br>This project was set up to be like a game jam on itch.io with 5 prizes to be won. We got 5th place overall, but we at least got 2nd place for gameplay, with competition being really tight between Bug-off and another group.</span></p>
