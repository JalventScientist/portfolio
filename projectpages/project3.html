        <p>ASTEROIDS is a remake of the popular 1979 arcade game, Asteroids.</p>
        <p>It's a small project that all the game developers did after each software developer made their choice to do XR, Web development or game development. I, of course, chose game development, hence this project.</p>

        <p>This project was made with each for themselves; a couple weeks, making the game by yourself using a guide. I was stubborn enough to not really follow the guide, but it still ended up being something that fit the criteria just fine.</p>
        <p>Had i strictly followed the guide, I would have been finished within a day or two, so I took some time to work on the looks of the game, making it stand out further.</p>

        <p>Something useful I did learn from this project and have been using ever since is inheritance. It saved me more time than anything.<br>
        The use of inheritance was only applied in the powerups, as it later on became required to make a custom power-up as well. I went with giving the spaceship a minigun for my own powerup, because I thought it would be funny to remove the limit of the firerate.</p>
        <p>It was optional to have this project be built as a WEBGL game, but <span class="drama">I had not optimized the game to be playable on web.</span> Aside from high quality models that used PBR, the UI was, once again, messed up because it was set for strict resolutions only.</p>
        </p>
        <p><br>Since this was a project only I worked on, I sometimes messed around a bit, creating some funny code, mostly seen in the screen once you finished playing. I did make sure to keep it high-effort, though.</span></p>
        <p><br>There were a few issues in terms of formatting my code, such as sticking to either camelcase or pascalcase. For the rest, I finished this project with a solid grade.</p>
